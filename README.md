# OpenShare.Net
 OpenShare.Net is a shared library with common components that I have created and/or adapted from stackoverflow and many other sources that save me a lot of time. Hope you enjoy. I may make samples at some point. There are plenty of extension methods in Library.Common. The Library.Repository has EntityIdentityRepository that should be checked out and derived from. There are other interfaces for those cases where someone didn't follow that Id base named key. As well, ClientPool in Library.Threading is a sweet new edition.
